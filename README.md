# ByteVerse-Odyssey-A-32-bit-Linux-Like-OS

In our collaborative endeavor within the ECE 391 class, my team and I embarked on the ambitious task of developing a 32-bit operating system, showcasing a collective mastery of low-level programming and intricate hardware interaction. Our project was a testament to our advanced proficiency in languages such as C and x86 assembly, as we meticulously engineered a robust kernel for a single-core x86 system.

The core of our operating system featured a comprehensive set of functionalities, including virtual memory paging, Real-Time Clock (RTC) integration, keyboard-mouse support, efficient system calls, and a per-terminal round-robin scheduler. This multifaceted approach not only demonstrated our technical acumen but also underscored our commitment to crafting an operating system that could seamlessly handle diverse tasks and user interactions.

An emphasis on paging-only virtual memory and a read-only filesystem served as strategic design choices aimed at optimizing responsiveness through efficient context switching and multitasking. The result was a streamlined and efficient operating system architecture that reflected the collaborative efforts of our team in the ECE 391 class, showcasing not only our technical prowess but also our ability to work together in tackling complex challenges in the realm of operating systems development.
